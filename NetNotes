//1.5 Intro to IP Addressing
/*
In this episode, Mike introduces you to logical addressing. 
	You will learn how it is used to enable larger groups of computers into networks. 
	You will then explore the most commonly used addressing scheme today - IP addresses.

Logical Addressing
	IP addressing
		32.44.17.231
	Not Fixed (Necessarily)
	32.44.17._
		Network
	110.14.56._
		different Network || "Broadcast Domain"
		
Router
	router(many with built in switches)
	looks at IP addresses
	connects multiple LANs
	
InterNet Communication
	frame (packets in frames) [macTo, macFrom, packet, CRC (Cyclical Redundancy Check)]
		destination 	IP
		Source		IP
		"IP Packet":
			within frames (always within the frame, never alone)
				destinationIP
				fromIP
				defaultGateway
				destinationMAC
				routerMAC
		router strips away "The Frame" stuff
			leaving only the IP packet
			"Routing Table"
			
	Default Gateway
		the address to the router itself

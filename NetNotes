//1.8 OSI Model vs. TCP/IP model
/*
This video covers 
	In this video, you will learn about the 
		two models used in computer networking and the differences between them.

*/

Network Models
	Represent how networks function
	Types of Network Models
		OSI 7-Layer Model
			1 - Physical
				cabling, etc
			2 - data link layer
				MAC address
				NIC
				Switches
			3 - Network Layer
				logical addresses
					IP addresses
					router
			4 - Transport Layer
				packets
					Assemble - Disassemble 
			5 - Session 
				connection between 2 systems
					TCP?
					email?
					LAN comms?
			6 - Presentation
				Format data into a form that the application can read
			7 - Application
				Microsoft word:
				API: 
					definition of "smarts" that allow the application to be "network aware"
		
				
		TCP/IP model
			1 - Network Interface Layer
				phys cabling, MAC, NICs, (hardware, NOT routers)
			2 - Internet
				IP addresses
					routers
			3 - Transport
				assemble/ disassemble
				everything it takes for that data to get to other machine
				(Session layer of OSI may be thought of here unnoficially)
			4 - Application
				OSI
					application, presentation & session layer
				Different than OSI
				application
					email, ftp, telnet

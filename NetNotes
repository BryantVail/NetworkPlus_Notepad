//2.0 OSI & TCP/IP Model Walkthroughs
8:16
/*
In this video, you will learn how to take an Ethernet frame through the processes involved incoming and outgoing and use both the OSI and TCP/IP models for reference

*/

1. Frame Into NIC
	look at incoming mac
		is it for me?
		verify ethernet frame is good
		strip MACs, 
			persist RETURN  mac
	Packet

Network Models
	Represent how networks function
	Types of Network Models
		OSI 7-Layer Model
			1 - Physical
				cabling, etc
			2 - data link layer
				MAC address
				NIC
				Switches
			3 - Network Layer
				logical addresses
					IP addresses
					router
				after filtered by IP
					**"TCP segment" is left**
			4 - Transport Layer
				packets
					Assemble - Disassemble 
				sending || receiving
				"Sequencing"
			5 - Session 
				connection between 2 systems
					TCP?
					email?
					LAN comms?
			6 - Presentation
				Format data into a form that the application can read
			7 - Application
				Microsoft word:
				API: 
					definition of "smarts" that allow the application to be "network aware"
		
				
		TCP/IP model
			1 - Network Interface Layer (sometimes called: "Link" Layer in TCP/IP)
				phys cabling, MAC, NICs, (hardware, NOT routers)
			2 - Internet
				IP addresses
					routers
			3 - Transport
				assemble/ disassemble
				everything it takes for that data to get to other machine
				(Session layer of OSI may be thought of here unnoficially)
			4 - Application
				OSI
					application, presentation & session layer
				Different than OSI
				application
					email, ftp, telnet
